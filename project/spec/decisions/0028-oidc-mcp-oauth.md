# 0028: MCP OAuth through the configured OIDC issuer

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** September 14, 2026

Supersedes the "MCP OAuth" exclusion recorded in
[0020: Generic OIDC browser login](0020-generic-oidc-login.md).

## Decision

An installation that configures a generic OIDC issuer for browser login now
also accepts end-user access tokens from that issuer at `/mcp`. A second
implementation of the existing `ExternalMcpBearerVerifier` port,
`OidcMcpBearerVerifier`, sits beside the WorkOS one. Managed API keys keep
working and are still checked first, so nothing an installation already uses
changes.

0020 excluded this on the reading that a bare enterprise identity provider is
not an authorization server MCP clients can register against. Keycloak, Entra,
Okta, and Auth0 all publish `/.well-known/openid-configuration`, most of them
offer dynamic client registration, and an MCP client that reads RFC 9728
protected-resource metadata reaches the issuer on its own. What the exclusion
actually costs is real: without it every agent on a self-hosted installation
shares one API key, and the server records one author for everyone behind it.

## What it does

Startup fetches the issuer's OIDC discovery document, validates it, and keeps
three things: the JWKS URI, the userinfo endpoint, and the document itself. The
document is served back at `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, and
`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` names the issuer as the
authorization server for the `<origin>/mcp` resource. An unauthenticated MCP
request answers 401 with `resource_metadata`, which is the whole handshake an
MCP client needs.

A presented token is verified against the discovered JWKS: signature, RS256 or
ES256, exact issuer, audience, expiry, and a non-empty subject, with the same
thirty-second clock tolerance browser login uses. The member binding is
`oidc:<normalized issuer>` paired with `sub`, the same binding browser login
writes, so one person keeps one membership whichever way they arrive.

Identity on first use comes from the token's own `email`, `name`,
`given_name`, `family_name`, and `preferred_username` claims. An installation
whose access tokens carry no email falls back to the discovered userinfo
endpoint, called once with the presented token. Both paths end at the existing
admission gate, which still decides who may enter.

## Recorded decisions

### The audience is the MCP URL, and an operator may say otherwise

`aud` must contain `<ARTIFACT_SERVER_ORIGIN>/mcp`, per the MCP specification.
Membership is enough: Keycloak names `account` alongside the requested
audience, and refusing a multi-audience token would refuse Keycloak. An issuer
that cannot bind the resource URL at all is common enough that
`ARTIFACT_SERVER_OIDC_MCP_AUDIENCE` names the value it does bind. Setting it to
the client ID also makes ID tokens audience-valid, which is why the type check
below exists.

### An ID token is not an MCP credential

A payload `typ` of `ID` is refused. Keycloak marks its ID tokens that way, and
MCP-013-F requires that an ID token cannot substitute for an MCP credential
even when an operator has widened the accepted audience.

### Discovery runs at startup, and a down issuer only turns MCP OAuth off

The protected-resource document cannot be served without the discovery
document, so it is read once at startup, like the WorkOS path reads its
authorization-server metadata. Unlike that path, a discovery failure is not
fatal: the process writes one warning to stderr and starts with browser login
and managed API keys, which is exactly the behavior an installation had before
this change. An identity provider that is briefly down must not take the
artifact server down with it, and browser login keeps its own lazy discovery
anyway.

### The credential travels to identity resolution

`resolveIdentity` now receives the credential beside the verified claims. The
WorkOS implementation ignores it and reads its own API. The OIDC implementation
needs it, because an issuer's userinfo endpoint answers the presenter of the
token, not a server credential.

## What stays excluded

- OAuth on the HTTP API. `apiOAuthResource` and `externalApiBearerVerifier`
  stay unset, so `/api/` keeps accepting managed API keys only. Advertising an
  authorization server for a resource that cannot accept its tokens would be a
  false promise.
- Scope checks. The resource-bound audience grants MCP access, matching the
  rule MCP-011 already records for WorkOS.
- Dynamic client registration by Artifact Server. The issuer owns registration;
  Artifact Server only points clients at it.

## Rejected alternatives

### Keep MCP on API keys for OIDC installations

This is the status quo 0020 recorded. It gives every agent the same identity,
makes revocation all-or-nothing, and puts a long-lived shared secret into every
client configuration, including gateways that forward other people's requests.

### Cache the profile claims from `verify` for `resolveIdentity` to read

This avoids the port change by keeping token claims in a map between two calls
of the same request. It adds a cache with an eviction policy, a race, and a
failure mode that only appears under load, to avoid passing a value that the
caller already holds.

### Accept any audience and rely on the issuer check

An access token minted for another service in the same realm would then open
this one. Audience binding is the property that makes a resource server safe to
point several clients at.
